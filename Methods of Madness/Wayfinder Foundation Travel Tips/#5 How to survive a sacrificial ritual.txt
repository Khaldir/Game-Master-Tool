The sahuagin of Shargon’s Teeth, the Dragon Cult orcs of the Shadow Marches, the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes, the Seren barbarians, and even the drow and debased giants of Xen’drik—all these practice living sacrifi ce. As a service to its readers, the Rope and Piton provides the following advice to those who find themselves trussed to the stake.

Feign conversion. 
Take a cue from the thunder guides and always know the language spoken in the area you are exploring. If captured, call out in this language as if visited by a holy spirit and shout the praises of whatever deity is relevant.

Generate distraction. 
If you are a mage with the ability to cast spells by word alone, conjure a monster in the middle of the congregation. If your animal companion escaped and is lurking at the amphitheater’s perimeter, order it to howl. While the savages are focused elsewhere, make your escape.

Demonstrate unpalatability. Most sacrifi ce rituals demand a strong, pure victim. If you manifest signs of disease, madness, or any other trait that is anathema to the savages’ culture, you might be spared a death on the altar.
