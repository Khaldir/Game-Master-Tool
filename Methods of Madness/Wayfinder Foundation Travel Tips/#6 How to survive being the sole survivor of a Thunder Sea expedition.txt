The regions touched by the Thunder Sea are many and varied, but they are united in their degree of peril. Should you find yourself alone on a continent far from Khorvaire, observe the following guidelines.

Look for explorer marks. 
These precious signs can be a lifeline. You are not truly alone if you find writings left for you by your fellow explorers.

Do not be a “Khork.”
The veterans of Stormreach refer to those who leave Khorvaire for the first time as Khorks. A Khork expects there to be water around every corner, an everbright lantern over his shoulder when the sun sets, and a cooler cart of fruit and cheese to stop politely in his vicinity each meal hour. This will not happen in the wild. Always hoard water. Expect the worst and prepare for it.

Do not enter unexplored territory. 
Stay put if you can, since a rescue party is most likely to begin its search where you were last seen. Above all else, do not go somewhere that you have not previously ascertained to be safe. Among other dangers, your new location could prevent divination magic from locating you.
