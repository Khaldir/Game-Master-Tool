WAYFINDER FOUNDATION TRAVEL TIP: HOW TO SPEAK TO A BOUND ELEMENTAL

I am certain that the thought has crossed all our minds while riding on an airship: What if the fine heir of Lyrandar piloting this vessel were to choke on a fishbone at dinner and die on the spot? Could any of us seize control of this ship and safely guide it to town? Rest assured that such thoughts will trouble you no longer if you keep the following steps in mind.

Approach the helm, usually located to the rear of the ship’s top deck. Look for the elegantly carved wooden wheel.

Address the elemental in a firm, resolute voice. Make it know that you will be giving it orders now, and it will do as you command. It is important that you set the tone for your relationship with the creature as early as possible, and that tone must be one of superiority.

Above all else, avoid bargaining or making deals with the elemental. Do not promise it freedom or rest or any such luxury; merely command it to do as you wish.

With luck, the elemental will already be following your orders. If not, try again, but be more indignant, demanding to know how it dares defy you. Try to work up a good righteous anger.

If all else fails, allow someone else to try. People with good speaking voices, such as actors or singers, have been known to have a knack for projecting the appropriate sense of command.
