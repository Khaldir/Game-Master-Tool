It has recently come to the attention of the Wayfinder Foundation that an increasing number of explorers of the Lost Continent, when faced with an angry band of dark elf savages, are attempting to battle (or worse yet, parley) their way out of the situation. We cannot emphasize enough that this is NOT recommended procedure. We present this more rational approach to extricating oneself to safety.

Begin running.
If possible, run back toward your vessel or mounts. If no such conveyance is available, simply run directly away from the dark elves.
If you are carrying sufficient quantities of antitoxin—and by all means, you should be—begin quaffi ng liberally while running. Dark elves make extensive use of poisoned arrows and spears, and a quick nip of preventative elixir has saved more than one explorer.

Try to keep to brightly lit areas.
The dark elves find the glorious sun uncomfortable, even painful, and may be discouraged from pursuit if forced to follow you across a wide-open savannah at noon.

If all else fails, try leading your dark elf pursuers toward any encampments of giants you have previously encountered. With luck, the two races’ mutual enmity should cause them to begin attacking one another, allowing you to slip away in the confusion. However, be warned that this trick has a high likelihood of leaving you facing an angry group of giants, which may be worse than your current situation.
