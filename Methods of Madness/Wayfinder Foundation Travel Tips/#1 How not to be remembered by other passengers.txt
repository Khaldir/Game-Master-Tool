We have all had those moments when it was most appropriate to depart a region without further notice by the locals, whether from financial agreements gone awry or an inappropriate evening spent with a farmer’s son or daughter. If you find yourself in such a position, your best course of action is to leave with all haste and a minimum of remembrances, keeping the following points in mind.

Don’t panic.
People tend to remember strong emotions; if anyone witnesses you distraught or worried, they are far more likely to recall you later. If you can, appear bored or mildly impatient to better blend in with other passengers.

Avoid bright colors. 
Wearing gray, brown, tan, and other neutral tones lessens the impression you make in your fellow travelers’ minds. Keep any weapons or armor in your pack, rather than displaying them openly.

Do not be a warforged, goblinoid, or shifter. 
We hate to be so dreadfully blunt, but these races still inspire discomfort (if not outright fear) in many commoners, and such feelings are always remembered. If possible, members of these races should disguise themselves as another race before boarding public transportation.

Hide in plain sight. 
Don’t skulk off to an isolated corner. Sit with your fellow passengers, taking notice of them and smiling at what they say. You would be surprised how quickly normal interaction, however pleasant, is forgotten, while abnormal behavior is remembered far longer.
