The repair unit can also create spare parts, unless the GM rules that the parts are too specialized or rare (in which case, the unit repairs the device except for the specialized part).  Repair time is 1d100 + 20 minutes.
Repeater
Level: 1d6 + 1; Effect: For the next minute, the user’s ranged weapon fires one additional time with ammo fabricated by the cypher. The weapon wielder can aim the free shot at the same target as the initiating shot, or at a target next to the first one.

Level: 1d6; Effect: For the next twenty-four hours, anyone striking the user receives a small burst of electricity that inflicts 1 point of damage (no action or roll required).
Secret
Level: 1d6; Effect: The user can ask the GM one question and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find by looking somewhere other than his current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is level 10, and such knowledge is always open to interpretation.
Sheen
Level: 1d6; Effect: For one week, the user’s cells are coated with a protective veneer that resists damage (+1 to Armour) and decreases the difficulty of Might defence rolls by two steps. However, healing is more difficult during this time; all recovery rolls suffer a –1 penalty

Once activated, this boost can be used a number of times equal to the cypher’s level, but only within a twenty-four hour period. The boost takes effect each time the action is performed. [d100] ({01-15} Melee attack; {16-30} Ranged attack; {31-40} Speed defence; {41-50} Might defence; {51-60} Intellect defence; {61-68} Jumping; {69-76} Climbing; {77-84} Running; {85-92} Swimming {93-94} Sneaking {95-96} Balancing {97-98} Perceiving {99} Carrying {00} Escaping.)
Slave Maker
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on a melee attack against a creature about the size of the user and whose level does not exceed the cypher’s level. The cypher bonds to the target, who immediately becomes calm. The target awaits the user’s commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level minus the target’s level.  (If the result is 0, the target remains enslaved for one minute.)

Spatial Warp
Level: 1d6 + 4; Effect: When affixed to a device that affects a single target at range, that range is increased to 1 mile (2 km) with no penalties. Space is temporarily warped in terms of seeing and reaching the target. If direct line of sight is important to the device’s effect, it remains important.
Speed Boost
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: Adds 1 to Speed Edge for one hour.
Spy
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: Produces a tiny spying object that resists detection as a level 8 creature.  The object moves at great speed, mapping and scanning an unknown area. It moves 500 feet (152 m) per level, scanning an area up to 50 feet (15 m) away from it. It identifies basic layout, creatures, and major energy sources. Its movement is blocked by any physical or energy barrier. At the end of its mapping run, it returns to the user and reports. If it discovers a predefined target during its run (such as “a creature of level 5 or higher,” “a locked door,” “a major energy source,” and so on), it detonates instead, dealing electrical and shrapnel damage equal to the cypher’s level to all creatures and objects in short range.
Stasis Keeper
Level: 1d6; Effect: Puts a subject into stasis for a number of days equal to the cypher’s level, or until it is violently disturbed. An object in stasis does not age and comes out of the stasis alive and in the same condition as it went in, with no memory of the period of inactivity.

The field lasts for one minute. It affects the minds of thinking beings within the field, preventing them from taking hostile actions. The effect lasts as long as they remain in the field and for 1d6 rounds after, although an Intellect defence roll is allowed each round to act normally (both in the field and after leaving it).
Telepathy
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: For one hour, the device enables long-range mental communication with anyone the user can see.
Teleporter (Bounder)

Tissue Regeneration
Level: 1d6 + 4; Effect: For the next hour, the user regains 1 point lost to damage per round, up to a total number of points equal to twice the cypher’s level. As each point is regained, they choose which Pool to add it to. If all their Pools are at maximum, the regeneration pauses until they takes more damage, at which point it begins again (if any time remains in the hour) until the duration expires.
Tracer
Level: 1d6; Effect: Fires a microscopic tracer that clings to any surface within short range. For the next twenty-four hours, the launcher shows the distance and direction to the tracer, as long as it is in the same dimension.
Trick Embedder
Level: 1d6; Effect: A non-intelligent animal immediately and perfectly learns one trick it is capable of physically performing. The trick must be designated when the cypher is activated.
Uninterruptible Power Source
Level: 1d6 + 4; Effect: Provides power appropriate to another device for up to a day. The device to be powered can be as simple as a light source or as complex as a small starcraft, assuming the cypher’s level is equal to the item’s power requirements. A desk lamp is a level 1 power requirement, a car engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a starship is a level 10 power requirement.
Vanisher
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: The user becomes invisible for ten minutes, during which time they are specialized in stealth and Speed defence tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal their presence or position. If this occurs, they can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding their position.

Zero Point Field
Level: 1d6 + 3; Effect: Renders an inanimate object outside the effects of most energy for one minute. This means the object cannot be harmed, moved, or manipulated in any way. It remains in place (even in mid-air).
Area Boost
Level: 1d6 + 1; Effect: If you use an ability that affects a single target, this cypher expands the effect so it includes the immediate area around that target. If the power normally affects an immediate area, the area becomes short. Short areas are increased to long. Abilities with long-distance areas become 500-foot (152 m) areas. All other areas double in radius size.
Burst Boost
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: If you use an ability that affects a single target at short range or farther, the range drops to immediate, but the ability affects all targets within immediate range.
Damage Boost
Level: 1d6 + 2; Effect: If you use an ability that inflicts damage, it inflicts additional damage equal to this cypher’s level.
